# Baymax - Alzheimer's Patient Healthcare Companion

Baymax is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based healthcare companion designed for Alzheimer's patients. It facilitates natural conversations with an AI model powered by the Gemini API. All interactions are stored in a database, enabling patients to retrieve information whenever they forget something by simply asking Baymax. Users can also upload documents for the AI to reference. At the end of each day, Baymax generates a summary of the userâ€™s conversations and activities, which is emailed to their caretaker.
